# Summary
This repository implements a multi purpose controller for manipulators using the `ros2-control` framework and Gazebo for simulation.
The controller exploits `KDL` and urdf parsing to resize its variables accordingly to the DOFs of the manipulator and implements the following control techniques:
- PD with gravity compensation
- Computed torque
- Backstepping
- Adaptive Backstepping

The `robots_description` package implements a modified [franka panda](https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros) URDF description where the joints have been modified to be without limits, while `controller_error_msgs` contains the messages used to monitor the controller error, send the desired pose and twist, and set desired gains.

## Note on the Adaptive Backstepping Controller
For the adaptive controllers, a regressor formulation is needed, so it requires a symbolic formulation of the robot. The files `panda_gen.cpp`, `thunder_panda.cpp` and all the headers int he `panda_generated` folder are, as the name suggests, generated by the [thunder_dinamycs](https://github.com/CentroEPiaggio/thunder_dynamics) library.

# Usage
To launch the Gazebo simulation, after compiling and sourcing the environment, run ``ros2 launch robots_description panda_gazebo.launch.py``. This will launch both the controller (and the `robot_state_publisher`) and the simulation.
## Configuration
The configuration of the controller can be done by modifying `panda_multi_controller.yaml` file inside the `robots_description` package. The parameters are the following:
- **joints**: list of all the joints offering the selected command/state interfaces
- **description_topic**: the name of the topic where the robot's description is being published
- **base_link**: name of the link acting as the base of the manipulator
- **ee_link**: name of the link considered the end effector; this can be any link along the cinematic chain (different from `base_link`)
- **controller_type**: selects type of control to use:
  - `PD` - PD with Gravity compensation
  - `CT` - Computed Torque
  - `B` - Backstepping
  - `A` - Adaptive Backstepping
- **Kp_p/Kv_p**: position gains for proportional/derivative gain matrices
- **Kp_o/Kv_o**: orientation gains for proportional/derivative gain matrices
- **Kv**: only present if the derivative gain matrix is in joint space;
- **r**: (Adaptive only) regressor gain
